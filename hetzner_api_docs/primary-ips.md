## Primary IPs

Primary IPs help you to create more flexible networking setups. You can assign at most one Primary IP of type `ipv4` and one of type `ipv6` per Server. This Server then uses these IPs.

You can only unassign a Primary IP from a Server when it's powered off. This Primary IP can then be assigned to a different powered off Server, or you can keep it around for later use.

Primary IPs are bound to a specific Datacenter. You can not assign a Primary IP from one Datacenter to a Server in a different Datacenter. If you need this capability use Floating IPs instead.

If your Server's operating system supports cloud-init there is no further configuration needed to make Primary IPs work.

Primary IPs of type `ipv4` use a single IPv4 address as their `ip` property. Primary IPs of type `ipv6` use a /64 network such as `fc00::/64` as their `ip` property. Any IP address within that network can be used on your host.

Primary IPs are billed on an hourly basis.
