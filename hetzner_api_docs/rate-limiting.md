## Rate Limiting

All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain several headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.

- The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.
- The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.
- The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered, and you will have the full number of requests available again.

The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.
